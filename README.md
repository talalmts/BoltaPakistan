This system will provide the platform for the people of the Pakistan to launch their concerns/ complaint to the departments so that their problem and issues could be handle as soon as possible. On the other hand authorities could get a real-time overview of the city situation and plan ahead by analysis the data provided by the people around the city. The system will help the respective authorities which specific area and specific issues are common thus they can plan to eradicate those problem with swift and effective actions.

## Description:

This will generate their complaint number which will be later used to track the progress of their complaint. For better authentication media support will be available to the user for complementary their complaint with a fact. 
For the department the system will simple show user complaint, status and location and priority level adjusted by the department for better indication of problem. Information to the department will be display in a more useable manner that could correctly interpret the data to the department so they could be reactive and proactive to the situation of the civic problem.

## Requirement:
### System Administration Requirement
* Direct upload to a Server
###Non Functional Requirements
* Usability. The system must be used by a variety of staff, often working under time pressure and with different levels of experience using computer-based information systems.
* Reliability. The system must be available all the time. Its mean time to failure is as minimal as possible.
* Speed. Centralized large database is in the system. User/event response time must be fast.
* Operational costs. The operational costs of the system must be ‘reasonable’ for management.
### Functional Requirements
* Tax Payer Requirement
* Photos can be uploaded to show the severity of a situation.
* Time, date and Place can be written down for a problem.
* Response is shown on that problem, to know whether problem is solved or not.

### Modules:
Our Project will be implemented in two technologies: Web and Android Application. In Web Application, Authorities can view problem in different localities. It is based on Web, as authorities usually work on computer. Taxpaying /Complainer side will be implemented on Android Application. For verification, it is easier to upload a photo on their smart phones.

### Design Patterns
Model View Controller design for both Web and Android Application:
Model: Business Logic and Database
View: Page and Form management
Controller: Map user action to model Updates
In this design pattern, Database will be shared between web and android application. View and Controller design will be different for both.

## Target Audience:
Target audience of the system each and every tax paying person who want to improve their neighborhood for better and prospers Pakistan. Respective government department will using the system to get better understanding of the problem of the citizen of Pakistan and act accordingly to eliminate those problem.
